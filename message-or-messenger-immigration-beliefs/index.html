Using a large-scale experiment about immigration beliefs, we decompose the relative importance of partisan messages versus leader sources.

These treatments are benchmarked to identical speeches recorded by an actor to control for message content, and to nonideological presidential speeches to control for leader priming. We find that political leaders influence beliefs beyond the content of their messages when leaders deliver unanticipated messages to individuals in their own party.">
